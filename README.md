# LumberChecker
The program determines if the lumber is within tolerance, or if not report what dimension(s) were out of tolerance as a report.
Users can make mistakes, so the program will not crash if text is entered instead of numbers when expected, if an incorrect length is selected, or invalid data e.g. negative number(s), this will be indicated as an error in the report.
